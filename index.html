                    <h2>Data and analytics for smart mobility</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Annual spending on transportation infrastructure exceeds $70 billion in the US.  Our goal is to provide the information necessary to make smart decisions about these important investments in the context of rapidly changing vehicle technology and shifting policy priorities.  We do this by developing more sophistocated tools to analyze projects before they are built, leveraging new and emerging data sources to understand the performance of projects after they open, and communicating both to improve planning and design decisions.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">We are an active and growing transportation group in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/ce/">Department of Civil Engineering</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/">University of Kentucky</a>, Kentucky's flagship university.  We work in close collaboration with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ktc.uky.edu/">Kentucky Transportation Center</a>, which serves as the research arm of the state Transportation Cabinet.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">We are located in beautiful Lexington, Kentucky, a vibrant small city with the nation's first urban growth boundary.  Famous for bourbon, bluegrass and basketball, Lexington offers easy access to hiking, rock climbing and other recreational opportunities.</p>

                    <p class=".text-left">I’m originally from East Kentucky and after graduating with a B.S. in Mining Engineering as well as an MBA spent around a year and a half in the Coal industry.  Given the current economic climate, I felt it better to return to school and pursue my M.S. in Civil Engineering with a focus in Transportation.  Transportation is a dynamic field with many advancements coming in the near future which is the reason why I wanted to pursue the field.  Currently, my research revolves around data applications for probe GPS speed data using Python and other tools.  More specifically, my thesis involves using these GPS speed data to develop a data-driven approach to accurately identify the effects of congestion in work zones. </p>
					<p class=".text-left">In my spare time, I enjoy playing golf as well as racing anything I can get my hands on.  As of right now, I’m racing go-karts at the local track here in Lexington.</p>

                                <p> Transportation network companies have penetrated the transportation market in recent years. A recent study in San Francisco has found on a typical weekday there are over 170,000 trips made using TNCs, which is 15% of the total trips within San Francisco.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfcta.org/tncstoday"> (SFCTA TNC Report) </a> Shared mobility modes and rail ridership have increased nationwide in the last decade, but bus ridership has stagnated. Current Research suggests that TNCs complement transit by "filling in the gaps" and increasing accessibility. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apta.com/resources/reportsandpublications/Documents/APTA-Shared-Mobility.pdf"> (APTA Shared Mobility Report) </a> Their findings were that TNCs typically operate at night, when transit operates sparingly, and that TNCs lowered automobile use rather than transit use. Erhardt proposed a theory, "Uber Effect", to explain the declining bus ridership in San Francisco. This project builds upon upon that research by creating a stop level direct ridership model to find what factors influence bus ridership in San Francisco. Then using panel data regression, the effects of each factor are quantified. This project aims to quantify the effect TNC use has on bus ridership within San Francisco, and propose policy changes to optimize the services TNCs and transit offer.

                                <p>The San Francisco County Transportation Authoirty (SFCTA) sought to use its existing activity-based travel model, SF-CHAMP, to study the impact of area and cordon pricing policies in downtown San Francisco.  To accomplish this, a set of model improvement were undertaken to improve the models treatment of pricing.  These including expanding the geographical bounds of SF-CHAMP to cover the 9-county Bay Area, estimating new time-of-day models that are properly responsive to peak period pricing,  and leveraging the microsimulation nature of the models to draw values of time from a continuous distribution rather than using averages.  This value-of-time improvement was the first of its kind in an activity-based model and allowed the model reflect the full diversity of the sample population with respect to their willingness to pay tolls.</p>

                                <p>This research aims to assess the expected cost and utility that can be expected to accrue from developing or upgrading a statewide travel demand model.  
								</p>
								
								<p>The core audience for this report is technical or planning staff at state transportation agencies who must make a recommendation on whether and how to engage in statewide modeling at their agency.  To make a recommendation, those individuals need to specify a budget request both in terms of external costs (consultants and materials) and in terms of staff time.  They also need to be able to, at a minimum, articulate, and preferably quantify, the value they expect to achieve by pursuing the proposed approach.  
								</p>
								
								<p>This ongoing research will quantify the costs of statewide models, and both identify and quantify the benefits of statewide models in a range of situations.  It will accomplish this using a novel approach that combines data on the revealed outcomes of existing statewide models, with the collective professional judgment of statewide modelers.  This will be done by offering statewide modelers a scenario-based survey in which they are asked to estimate the costs of a potential modeling project, as well as the utility of the model for different types of applications.  The project involves extensive outreach to all 50 state DOTs to administer the survey as a telephone-based interview.  
								</p>
								
								<p>This is the only study we are aware of to provide a rigorous measure of the utility of different types of models for different applications, and provides a template from which to start the utility assessment for forecasts.

                                <p>This research analyzes data from the Clipper Card system in the San Francisco Bay Area, and provides evidence for other agencies seeking to understand the value and limitations of their own data.  It considers how the data can be both useful to the transportation planning process, while a the same time respectful of the privacy of the users. The evaluation goes on to compare this new data set to onboard transit survey data for the same transit systems.  It finds that the smart card data under-represent minority and low-income travelers, relative to the onboard surveys, potentially creating equity issues if the data are used in planning without accounting for these biases.  Broadly, this is an exploration of how to take advantage of both Big Data sources and more traditional transportation surveys.

                                <p>Roadway lighting represents a safety improvement to nighttime driving conditions and promotes increased visibility for driver navigation.  State departments of transportation (DOTs) recognize the safety benefits of roadway lighting and subsequently devote significant monetary resources for the installation, operation, and maintenance of roadway lighting.  Lighting maintenance costs, including electrical power consumption, often run in the millions of dollars annually.  Today’s budgetary constrained environment requires state governments do more with less, and this adage applies to transportation operations as well.  In light of this, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is seeking cost-effective ways to reduce operational costs for roadway lighting while ensuring appropriate levels of safety are provided. This project will assess overall roadway lighting practices, with specific attention to evaluation of opportunities to reduce lighting operational costs through use of LED technology.

                                <p>When one thinks about their normal commute, they most likely have a set number of minutes on how long it takes to get to and from work at a given time.  This is widely known as travel time.  Sure, this is fine for an estimate, but in reality this person is going to either overshoot or undershoot their arrival based on traffic conditions.  This condition is a function of the reliability of the roadway, or the distribution of travel times a traveler experiences on their particular path.  Our research focuses on using big data and applications such as python script and other data processing tools to process speed data from various sources, such as GPS probe-speed-data sourced by private data vendors or speed data captured by Bluetooth sensors.  For example, the above chart is a heat map of probe GPS speeds along Lexington, KY’s Man O War Boulevard Inner Loop.  Ultimately, understanding travel time and reliability and their associated costs can aid DOT’s in selecting effective roadway projects to maximize the benefit of travelers using the roadway system.
